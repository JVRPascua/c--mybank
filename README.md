THIS PROJECT IS TO ENHANCE MY PAST SCHOOL PROJECT FOR A SUBJECT CALLED INTEGRATIVE PROGRAMMING

This is composed of a login page, admin dashboard, user dashboard, registration page (Admin Priviledge), deposit page, and withdrae page.

The tools that I used are Android Studio, XAMPP, CMDER, Git and Github. (Started using git and github ONLY for the enhancement and NOT on the initial development)

The data file used is ASPX, code is C#, and CSS with Bootstrap template for the layout.
